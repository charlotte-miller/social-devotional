                Social Devotional:
                
                Our mission is to educate, encourage and equip the church with every effective technology.  
                
                  - Educate: 	Clarify the nature of God and creation
                  - Encourage: 	Stir the faith of the young, tired, &amp; dry believer
                  - Equip:		Supply resources to stand against evil
                
                Our plan is to spread the existing work of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers as wise stewards of the technology gifted to our generation.
                
                
                Ephesians 4:11-15
                Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers.  Their responsibility is to equip God's people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ.  This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ.
                
                Then we will no longer be immature like children.  We won't we tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching.  We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like truth.  Instead we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church.

                    This section explains the functionality of the site. It describes each system and details how they may work together to educate, encourage and equip the church.
                    
                    Each feature answers the following questions:
                    
                      1) Why build this feature?
                      2) Who will benefit?
                      3) What will the feature do?
                     
                    Although the features are organized into sections, the wireframes (mockups) provide a better understanding of the site's structure.

                                        The system provides a popover of the verse
                                        And a link to the verse in context

                                        The system should:
                                        - wrap the url in an anchor tag (nofollow, target=blank, title=original_url)
                                        - anchor body is truncated at 30 char
                                        
                                        Bonus Points:
                                        - Fetch the url.title and set that as the anchor body
                                        - UI allows members to:
                                        --- update anchor body

                        In order to protect members from inaccurate, irrelevant, or abusive content
                        The community
                        Relies on a moderation system with the following design goals:
                        
                        - Respect individual preferences and allow users to tailor their experience
                           Example: Members may block any person or content - removing it for them
                        
                        - Leverage the 'wisdom of crowds' by acting on the community's feedback
                           Example: New posts are automatically pulled for review when the initial response is predominately negative 
                        
                        - Provide leaders and staff with tools to prevent abuse &amp; guide conversations
                           Example: A moderation feed allows staff to answer questions or suspend members without leaving the tool

                            However, suspicious posts are:
                            - not published to the site
                            - flagged for approval in the moderator's feed
                            
                            What is Questionable content:
                            - believed profane (profanity blacklist)

                            - containing sql injection or script tags
                            - part of a publishing flood
                            	- too many posts too quickly
                            	- similar or identical content
