Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers.  **Their responsibility is to equip God's people** to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ.  This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ.

Then we will no longer be immature like children.  We won't we tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching.  We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like truth.  Instead we will **speak truth in love**, growing in every way more and more like Christ who is the head of his body, the church.  Ephesians 4:11-15
